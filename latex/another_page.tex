The functions in this assignment are made with these algorithms in mind.\hypertarget{another_page_task1_sec}{}\doxysection{String Formatting\+:}\label{another_page_task1_sec}
Step 1. Receive input string from user.

Step 2. Tokenize string into 3 or 4 tokens, each containing the statement, the rule and the line(s).

Step 3. If necessary, remove brackets from compound statements.

Step 4. Reformat statement to get the 2 propositional statements present in the compound statement involving each rule.

Step 5. Check for the rule used in each statement.

Step 6. Check if each rule is valid.

Step 7. If all rules are valid, print \char`\"{}\+Valid Proof\char`\"{}. If any statement is invalid, print \char`\"{}\+Invalid Proof\char`\"{}.

Step 8 Exit.\hypertarget{another_page_task2_sec}{}\doxysection{Add PREMISE\+:}\label{another_page_task2_sec}
Step 1. Take 2 string vectors as parameters.

Step 2. Assign first vector as Tokens of input string.

Step 3. Save premise statement in Token\mbox{[}0\mbox{]} to second vector Lines

Step 4. Return true.\hypertarget{another_page_task3_sec}{}\doxysection{AND Introduction\+:}\label{another_page_task3_sec}
Step 1\+:Take 2 string vectors as parameters.

Step 2\+:Assign first vector as Tokens of input string.

Step 3. Remove brackets of input string, stored in Token\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}

Step 4\+: Reformat new string to separate 2 propositional statements conjoined by \textquotesingle{}$^\wedge$\textquotesingle{}.

Step 5\+: Check if both statements are stored in the Lines vector using the lines inputed.

Step 6\+: If yes, AND introduction rule is valid and return true, else return false.\hypertarget{another_page_task4_sec}{}\doxysection{AND elimination\+:}\label{another_page_task4_sec}
Step 1.\+Take 2 string vectors as parameters.

Step 2. Assign first vector as Tokens of input string.

Step 3. Remove brackets of AND induced string mentioned by line number in input string.

Step 4\+: Reformat new AND string to get both halves of the rule.

Step 5. Check if inputed statement is equal to one half of the AND string.

Step 6. If yes, AND elimination holds and return true, else return false.\hypertarget{another_page_task5_sec}{}\doxysection{OR Introduction\+:}\label{another_page_task5_sec}
Step 1\+:Take 2 string vectors as parameters.

Step 2\+:Assign first vector as Tokens of input string.

Step 3. Remove brackets of input string, stored in Token\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}

Step 4\+: Reformat new string to separate 2 propositional statements conjoined by \textquotesingle{}v\textquotesingle{}.

Step 5\+: Check if one of the halves is equal to the statement in vector Lines mentioned by the line number in input statement.

Step 6\+: If yes, OR introduction rule is valid and return true, else return false.\hypertarget{another_page_task4_sec}{}\doxysection{AND elimination\+:}\label{another_page_task4_sec}
Step 1.\+Take 2 string vectors as parameters.

Step 2. Assign first vector as Tokens of input string.

Step 3. Remove brackets of IMPLICATION induced string mentioned by line number in input string.

Step 4\+: Reformat new IMPLICATION string to get both halves of the rule.

Step 5. Check if first half of the reformated string is present as a line in LINE vector and second half of the reformated string is present as a token of input statement.

Step 6. If yes, IMPLICATION elimination holds and return true, else return false.\hypertarget{another_page_task4_sec}{}\doxysection{AND elimination\+:}\label{another_page_task4_sec}
